-	Within my first month of employment, the primary developer who maintained and added features to the services for one of our largest clients took another job. After his departure, I immediately stepped in and took responsibility for development on this client. In my time at Apex, I’ve helped add more features and business to this client as well as ensure quality on development that was done before I was hired.
-	When I first started, the company had no internal communication system. Everyone either had face to face conversations or had incongruous communication through email. I initiated and led the effort to get all employees on Slack, and it is now our primary channel for communication. It has helped the company become more unified and allows for us to more quickly address the needs of our clients.
-	The company has been going through a merger with another company in Minnesota this past year. I’m working with our system architects to integrate our systems with our new parent company’s systems. This has included learning and becoming familiar with their system and refactoring our code to work with their system. This will allow the company to provide more services to our current clients and will also help attract new clients to the new services that we will be able to provide after the merger.
-	Other tasks include developing and modifying .NET Windows Services used to parse and process large data files, maintaining and adding features to an internal web application, and writing SQL queries to gather and present relevant data to Account Managers and clients while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
